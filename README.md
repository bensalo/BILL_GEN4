# BILL_GEN4 (Read.me WIP)


currently copy of the wiki main page: 

Welcome to the BILL_GEN4 wiki!

This tool is able to create bills as a pdf file.

To use it properly you have to insert customers data into a local database (TinyDB).

At the moment customers needs to be inserted manually into the json file. -> but a customer managing window is coming soon !!

Created Bills get exported as a pdf file and are also stored in a TinyDB with the most important values of the bill (but not all of them).

By Bill Creation you can see the 'letze_rechnungsnummer' to manually put in the next 'rechnungsnummer' -> automatic rechnungsnummer calculater *coming soon
