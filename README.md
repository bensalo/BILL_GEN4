# BILL_GEN4 Read.me

In order to use the bill generator properly you have to insert customers into the database.

You can do this by manually editing the 'kunden.json' file. It is generated by the first database connection.
A window to add new customers is coming soon.

The bill file output ist not ready yet and a generated bill will always be saved in the project_repository.

Please feel free to write Issues on Bugs or wanted/needed features!
